# Memory Match

### Overview

> Version 1.0 continues where version 0.5 stopped by adding in the statistics of the memory match game. When a user clicks on a card the application will start tracking how many matches versus how many attempts. In combination with the stats there is also a tracker for how many times the game is played. Games played is tracked by resetting / restarting the game.

> Version 1.5: added features include display changes to matched cards, a map to display matched parks, and statistics on distances between parks.
